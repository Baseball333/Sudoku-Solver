# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a sudoku solver I wrote in Python in September 2019, employing the backtracking algorithm.

First commit:
This is the official initialization of the Python sudoku solver. This project was originally written in September 2019 with the intention of implementing the "backtracking" algorithm. Although backtracking is commonly regarded among programmers I will account those who are not familiar and explain backtracking to them. To comprehend backtracking a programmer must be aware of the "naive algorithm".

Second commit:
The naive algorithm is a manner of representing quantities by selecting every possible value from 1-9. The naive algorithm's application is especially evident in sudoku, where possible solutions to blank spaces are often employed usingr the naive algorithm. Although the naive algorithm remains a viable solution to such problems, it is computationally inefficient. Note how most of the programmers which apply the naive algorithm are unaware of backtracking's algorithm.
