# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a sudoku solver I wrote in Python in September 2019, employing the backtracking algorithm.

First commit:
This is the official initialization of the Python sudoku solver. This project was originally written in September 2019 with the intention of implementing the "backtracking" algorithm. Although backtracking is commonly regarded among programmers I will account those who are not familiar and explain backtracking to them. To comprehend backtracking a programmer must be aware of the "naive algorithm".
